# agent-web-playwright-learn
- Build an agent with access to web pages using playwright
- Playwright as tool requires extra caution with strands because of event loops. Browser needs to be running in the same eventloop always, else weird errors were happening when requests come from different loop. Possibly i am new to python and missing something.
